## Objectives

We want to achieve the following situation:

- Each of you has a GitHub account.
- In this account is an individual repository that is cloned as a folder onto your local harddrive, e.g. `2020-ws_doxy`
- In this locally cloned folder is a test file with your test presentation `slides.md` for you to practice working with `VS Code`, `reveal-md`, `GitHub Desktop`, `commits`, `push` and of course `Markdown`.

---

## Objectives (ctd.)

- Then you and your partner will use one of your accounts to setup a joint repository `2020-ws_doabcd` for your coursework.
- You can then both commit to this common folder.
- On the day of your presentation, clone the common repository to a local harddrive and present it.
